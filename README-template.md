3. Changed the font and colour as needed


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project, I was able to learn how to add a border to a circular image:

```css
.author {
  border-radius: 100%;
  border: 1px solid white;
  height: 1.6em;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue working with the displays, but also expanding my knowledge on the different types of properties they hold.
